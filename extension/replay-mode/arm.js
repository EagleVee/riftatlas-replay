/**
 * Hands a pending replay to the main world at document_start.
 *
 * Replay mode has to install its socket intercept before RiftAtlas opens its
 * match socket, which happens about two seconds into page load. That means
 * arming cannot wait for a popup click on an already-loaded page - the real
 * socket wins, and replay mode correctly refuses to displace it.
 *
 * So the popup stores a replay and reloads the tab; this runs at document_start
 * in the isolated world (where chrome APIs exist), reads it, and posts it to
 * inject.js in the main world (where they do not).
 *
 * Registered dynamically, only while a replay is pending, and consumed on
 * read - so replay mode stays something the user asks for once, not a script
 * that sits armed on every page load.
