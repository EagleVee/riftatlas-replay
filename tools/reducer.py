"""Reference implementation of the RiftAtlas authoritative-state reducer.

The realtime protocol is event-sourced: an `authoritative_snapshot` establishes
state at a sequence number, and each `authoritative_patch_commit` advances
`baseSequence` -> `sequence` by applying an ordered list of domain-level patch
operations. Replaying a snapshot plus its following commits reproduces the
server's state exactly.

This module is the normative spec for the JavaScript reducer in the extension.
Both must stay behaviourally identical; `verify.py` checks this one against the
snapshots embedded in a capture.
